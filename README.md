## Description

This web application is a random password generator that takes user input to determine which style of characters will be used in the password.

## Usage

To use this random password generator, start by clicking the "generate password" button. Upon clicking, the user will be prompted towards the top of the screen. The user will first be prompted to select a password length. If the user submits any characters outside of the requirements (<8, >128, or a non-number), they will be prompted to try again. If the user presses "cancel," the prompt will close. When the user inputs an appropriate password length, they will be prompted to choose if they want to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, each with its own separate prompt. Once all the prompts have been answered, the application will generate a random password into the designated box on the page, using the length and character types selected. If the user chooses none of the character types, the application will designate lowercase letters to be used. If the user would like to create a different password, just click on the "generate password" button again.
